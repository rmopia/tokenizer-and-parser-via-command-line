Synopsis
========
The purpose of this project is to learn how to tokenize and parse a file from the command line in the C++ language.

Part 1
========
Here we start by creating a Tokenizer file, called "prog2_1.cpp" with a seperate header file that includes four public members (but not limited to) :
* A constructor
* A destructor
* A Tokenize method
* A GetTokens method

The constructor is used to create a Tokenizer object and allocate memory.
